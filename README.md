# Harpoon

**Harpoon** aims to capture the syscalls (as if they were fishes) from the execution flow (the river) of a single user-defined function.

## Introduction

This tool is designed to provide fine-grained visibility into the syscalls made by specific functions within a program. Unlike traditional system call tracing tools like `strace`, which capture all syscalls made during the entire program's execution, this project leverages the power of **eBPF** to pinpoint and monitor system calls exclusively within targeted functions.

## Getting Started

First of all, let's identify the symbol of the function you want to trace from the binary. Suppose you want to trace the function `doSomething()` present in the example program `./binary`. In order to get the symbol from the binary itself, you need to use the following command:

```sh
objdump --syms ./binary | grep doSomething
0000000000480720 g     F .text  0000000000000067 main.doSomething
```

So, `main.doSomething` is the symbol of the function we want to trace using `harpoon`.

Then, let's run `harpoon` to extract the syscalls from the function `main.doSomething`:

```shell
harpoon capture -f main.doSomething -- ./binary
read
sigaltstack
gettid
close
mmap
fcntl
write
futex
openat
clone
getrlimit
```

These are the syscalls that have been executed by the traced function!

## Installation

To install `harpoon` you currently have 2 options:

### Download

You can easily download the latest release using the installation script:

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alegrey91/harpoon/main/install | sudo sh
```

Alternatively, if you want to customize your installation, use the following flags:

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alegrey91/harpoon/main/install | sudo sh -s -- --install-version v0.9 --install-dir ~/.local/bin/
```

(If your current version is `<= v0.8.2`, remove it from `/usr/local/bin/` before installing the new one).

### Build

Or you can build `harpoon` manually by using the following steps:

Install dependencies (for Ubuntu):

* `clang`
* `libbpf-dev`
* `libseccomp-dev`
* `linux-tools-generic` (for `bpftool`)

Build the application:

```sh
make build
```

After the build is completed, you can find the executable under the `bin/` directory.

## Debugging

In case you want to run the application locally, I've provided the [`.vscode/launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json) file to easily debug the application with `root` privileges in `vscode`.

## Talks

I had the pleasure of speaking about `harpoon` at the following conferences:

* [**Conf42**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8IHOTlG3pM) (Apr 24)
* [**FOSDEM**](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-1884-how-we-almost-secured-our-projects-by-writing-more-tests/) (Feb 24)
